<h3>Website Project</h3>
   <p>First of all, we finished CSS, HTML, and JS individually. Then, as a team of 17, we began to establish our website which is called “TOLERANT”. We used HTML to write titles and information on our website, to create a table, logo, and animated photo. CSS was used in the design of the site. For example, the background, the color of the letters or buttons are designed using CSS. It is also possible to find the clock created with the help of JavaScript at the top of the page. We hope that our website will create positive feedback on the users.</p>
